We are adding the link to the preprint which is now accepted in ICML 2024 workshop and will be presented as a talk and a poster this week in Vienna: [Link to the paper](https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2405.18585).

This study, led jointly by **Surya Dheeshjith** and **Adam Subel**, showcases Machine Learning Ocean Emulators accurately predicting global ocean surface conditions over 5-8 years under different COâ‚‚ forcing scenarios. While the models struggle to generalize, fine-tuning with small amounts of additional data from warner climates can significantly improve model performance. The study also shows the robustness of the emulators to noise in the atmospheric forcing. **Shubham Gupta**, **Alistair Adcroft**, **Carlos Fernandez-Granda**, **Julius Busecke**, and **Laure Zanna** all contributed to the work.
